# Fantasy Football Analytics Pro üèà

A comprehensive fantasy football analytics platform featuring advanced machine learning, real-time data integration, and intelligent start/sit recommendations.

## üéØ What This Project Does

This project solves the core problem of fantasy football lineup optimization by combining:
- **Machine Learning Models** trained on historical data to predict player performance
- **Real-Time Data Integration** from multiple sources (FantasyPros, Sleeper API)
- **Advanced Analytics** considering weather, matchups, game script, and player trends
- **Automated Roster Validation** ensuring data accuracy for the current NFL season

The system takes your fantasy team roster and provides ML-enhanced start/sit recommendations with confidence scores, helping you make optimal lineup decisions each week.

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

### 1. Data Collection & Integration
- **FantasyPros Scraping** (`api/fantasypros_scraper.py`) - Extracts player rankings and projections
- **Sleeper API Integration** (`automated_roster_updater.py`) - Fetches real-time player data
- **Roster Validation** (`verified_roster_updater.py`) - Ensures current team assignments

### 2. Machine Learning Pipeline
- **Model Training** (`robust_ml_system.py`) - Trains position-specific ML models
- **Feature Engineering** - 8+ predictive variables (weather, matchups, recent form, etc.)
- **Prediction Engine** - Generates enhanced projections with confidence scores

### 3. Optimization & Recommendations
- **Lineup Optimization** - Selects optimal starters based on ML projections
- **Start/Sit Analysis** - Provides clear recommendations with reasoning
- **Performance Tracking** - Monitors model accuracy and system performance
